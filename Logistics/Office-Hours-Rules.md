# Rules for Office Hours for Chris Carroll

1. Time slots are available in 15 minute increments
   * If you need 30 minutes, sign up for two
   * Do not sign up for more than 3 slots on a day
1. Use your last name and first initial 
   * In case another student wants to negotiate about times
   * Please communicate directly with the other student

If the posted hours are filled and you need to speak to me, email me to arrange an alternative time. (The likeliest availability will be after the end of regular office hours, so in your email you should ask me first whether I will be available for extended hours after the end of the next regularly scheduled ones).
