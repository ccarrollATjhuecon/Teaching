[Appointments for Chris Carroll's Office Hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UURtUGlGYmVCdFRLfGRlZmF1bHR8MjM3OTFkMDg5MDVhZTM5MDNiYzhjN2Y1MjNlMzRkMWQ)

1. Identify the time slot you would like to occupy
   * Time slots are available in 15 minute increments
   * If you need 30 minutes, sign up for two
   * Many (most?) appointments will probably need 30 minutes
   * Do not sign up for more than 3 slots on a day
1. In you want to negotiate with another student about times:
   * Please communicate directly with the other student
   * Then make the agreed changes on the calendar
1. When you have identified the time slot you want to fill:
   * Create a Zoom meeting ID for the meeting
   * Sign up for the appointment slot(s) on my calendar
   * Include the zoom link in the first slot
1. Use your last name and first and middle initial 
   * I would be CarrollCD
1. After you have signed up for your slot(s), 
   * send me a Google Calendar invitation to ccarroll@llorracc.org to make sure I know about the appointment and it's on my personal calendar

If the posted hours are filled and you need to speak to me, email me to arrange an alternative time. (The likeliest availability will be after the end of the departmental seminar, so in your email you should ask me first whether I will be available for extended hours at that time).
