These rules apply to appointments that can be made using the link at the end.

1. Identify the time slot(s) you would like to occupy
   * Time slots are available in 15 minute increments
   * If you need 30 minutes, sign up for two adjacent slots
     * Many appointments will probably need 30 minutes
   * Do not sign up for more than 3 slots on a day
     * Unless you let me know in advance you'll need an hour
1. When you have identified the time slot(s) you want to fill:
   * Click on the desired slot(s) on the calendar you see
   * the "location" will be MY Zoom link
1. Replace the "Book 1 or 2 slots ..." text
   * With your FULL name (or, better, your Moniker)
2. If you want to negotiate with a booked student to swap times:
   * Please communicate directly with the other student
     * JHU outlook should be able to find their email address
   * Then make the agreed changes on the calendar
1. After you have signed up for your slot(s), 
   * send me a Google Calendar invitation to ccarroll@llorracc.org
   * include the Zoom link to the meeting from the appointments calendar item
   * This is to make sure I know about the appointment
