# Rules for Office Hours for Chris Carroll

1. Time slots are available in 15 minute increments
   * If you need 30 minutes, sign up for two
   * Do not sign up for more than 3 slots on a day
1. Use your last name and first and middle initial 
   * I would be CarrollCD
1. In you want to negotiate with another student about times:
   * Please communicate directly with the other student
   * Then make the changes on the calendar

If the posted hours are filled and you need to speak to me, email me to arrange an alternative time. (The likeliest availability will be after the end of the departmental seminar, so in your email you should ask me first whether I will be available for extended hours at that time).
