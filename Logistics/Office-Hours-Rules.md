# Rules for Office Hours for Chris Carroll

These rules apply to appointments that can be made using the link at the end.

1. Identify the time slot(s) you would like to occupy
   * Time slots are available in 15 minute increments
   * If you need 30 minutes, sign up for two adjacent slots
     * Many appointments will probably need 30 minutes
   * Do not sign up for more than 3 slots on a day
1. When you have identified the time slot(s) you want to fill:
   * Create a Zoom link for the meeting
   * Click on the desired slot(s) on my calendar
   * Paste your zoom link in the event's "location" or "where" box
1. Replace the "Book 1 or 2 slots ..." text
   * With your name and your JHED-ID
2. If you want to negotiate with a booked student about times:
   * Please communicate directly with the other student
     * You can email them at [JHED-ID]@jh.edu
   * Then make the agreed changes on the calendar
1. After you have signed up for your slot(s), 
   * send me a Google Calendar invitation to ccarroll@llorracc.org
   * with the Zoom link in the "location" box
   * to make sure I know about the appointment and it's on my personal calendar
